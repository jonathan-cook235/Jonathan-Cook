## About me

My Undergraduate training is in Theoretical Physics at University College London. During my undergraduate studies, I worked with London Blockchain Labs on consulting in blockchain education and innovation and took part in a Technology Spring Insight Programme at Morgan Stanley. I am now conducting supervised research into machine learning models for detecting the spread of misinformation on social media sites with the Web Intelligence Group at the UCL Centre for Artificial Intelligence.
