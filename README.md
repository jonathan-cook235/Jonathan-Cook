# About me

I am a second year undergraduate student, reading Theoretical Physics at [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk). During my first year of study, I worked with London Blockchain Labs on consulting in blockchain education and innovation, before taking part in a Technology Spring Insight Programme at Morgan Stanley. Tangentially to my course, I am now conducting personal research into machine learning methods for social simulation.
